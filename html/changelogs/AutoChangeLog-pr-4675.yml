changes:
  - rscadd: Adds map_generator datums, which will handle terrain generation for a
      specific area.
  - rscadd: Adds a jungle generator datum, which uses rust-g noise to generate 3 layers
      of perlin noise to make a somewhat cohesive and seamless jungle based on height,
      humidity and heat.
